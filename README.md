## Getting started with OIOIDWS.Net.Core

`OIOIDWS.Net.Core` is a `.Net Core`- based reference implementation of the `OIOIDWS 1.0.1a` profile.

The `OIOIDWS.Net.Core` components can be used by service providers to act as a Web
Service Consumer (`WSC`) using the `SOAP` standard. Note that this Core implementation does not have functionality needed by a Web Service Producer (`WSP`).

This is the codebase that the `OIOIDWS.Net.Core` components are built from. All WSP examples found in this repository uses .Net framework.

### Getting started

The source code contains everything you need to set up a demonstration environment that federates with the `KOMBIT STS`.

_The full documentation of `OIOIDWS.Net.Core` is a combination of the various readme files, `API` documentation, and provided examples._

For a quick setup, follow these steps:

* Run the script `Setup\setup_prerequisites.ps1` from an elevated `PowerShell`. This installs all required certificates and performs `sslcert` bindings to host local websites using `HTTPS`.
* Open the solution `Digst.OioIdws.Core.sln` in `Visual Studio 2022` and build it (if you get errors on external dependencies, ensure `NuGet` packages are being restored).
* The external `IP` address must be whitelisted at `NETS` to make revocation check of the test `FOCES` certificates.
* Run one of example projects (`Digst.OioIdws.WscExampleCore`, `Digst.OioIdws.WscLocalTokenExampleCore`, `Digst.OioIdws.WscProxyOBOExampleCore`) for different scenarios. Due to restrictions on what service can use OBO use cases, you will likely only be able to try the `Digst.OioIdws.WscExampleCore` example out successfully.

To try the normal STS case against a `Java WSP`:

* Refer to the `Configuring WSP` section for how to set up and start the `Java WSP`
* Run the `Digst.OioIdws.DotnetWscJavaWspExampleCore` project to start a signature case scenario against a `Java WSP`. 

This should start a console application that will request an token from KOMBIT STS then use it to call the target WSP.

### Configuring WSP

#### .NET Framework

To run a local WSP, you need to use the `Digst.OioIdws.Core with WSP.sln' solution file. Right-click on the `Digst.OioIdws.WspExample` project and select `Debug` => `Start Without Debugging`. The WSP service will be ready to listen at https://Digst.OioIdws.Wsp:9899/HelloWorld. Refer to the `Configuring WSP` section for how to configure them.

The `Digst.OioIdws.WspExample` is a .NET WSP that supports both SOAP 1.1 and 1.2. To specify the SOAP version, you need to configure the `useSoap12` attribute in the `SoapBindingConfiguration` in the App.config file:

```XML
<binding name="SoapBindingConfiguration" useHttps="true" sendTimeout="00:15:00" useSoap12="false"/>
```

**Configure Trusted issuers**

The `trustedIssuers` list must contain the thumbprint of the signing certificate that a KOMBIT STS instance is using so that the WSP can accept security tokens from that STS:

```XML
<issuerNameRegistry>
  <trustedIssuers>
    <add name="sts.oioidws-net.dk" thumbprint="8081b09446a396ba0ff9b7159d07d8c90f7db9ae"/>
    <add name="test-ekstern-adgangsstyring" thumbprint="7002cf221d1d3979eca623599e43e0b6b4c8920c"/>
  </trustedIssuers>
</issuerNameRegistry>      
```

**Configure Audience Uris**

```
<audienceUris>
  <add value="https://wsp.oioidws-net.dk"/>
  <add value="http://wsp11.oioidws-net.dk/service/service/1"/>
  <add value="http://wsp12.oioidws-net.dk/service/service/1"/>
</audienceUris>
```

The Digst.OioIdws.WspSvcExample example is the same as the Digst.OioIdws.WspExample example, except the fact that it is an ASP.NET-based WCF that we can host on Azure App Service or IIS instead of running as a managed application (e.g. a .NET console application).

All settings are usually pre-configured correctly, so you do not need to make any changes though.

#### Java

We will use the Java WSP example at https://github.com/digst/OIOIDWS.Java as the WSP to test the **Digst.OioIdws.DotnetWscJavaWspExampleCore** example

Required steps to run the Holder-Of-Key Java WSP:

* Download Java 8 from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java8-windows
* Create a ``JAVA_HOME`` environment variable with value "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_351"
* Add "%JAVA_HOME%\bin" to the ``Path`` environment variable
* Add the STS certificate into service's ``trust.jks``
  * Access https://n2adgangsstyring.eksterntest-stoettesystemerne.dk/runtime/oauth2/certs.idp to get the certificate, or ask KOMBIT if you want to use another instance of KOMBIT STS, and save it as ``kombitsts.cer``.
  * Follow the instructions in the ``Update STS certificate`` at https://github.com/digst/OIOIDWS.Java#troubleshooting. Note that we are going to use the Holder-Of-Key WSP at "OIOIDWS.Java\examples\oio-idws-soap\service-hok"
  * You can copy the ``/Setup/create_trust.cmd`` file to ``OIOIDWS.Java\examples\oio-idws-soap\service-hok\src\main\resources`` along with the ``kombitsts.cer`` to import the STS certificate to ``trust.jks``
* Add restricted audience
	* Locate the``OIOIDWS.Java\examples\oio-idws-soap\service-hok\src\main\java\service\saml\igstSamlAssertionValidator.java`` class and add the audience URI (http://wsp12.oioidws-java.dk/service/service/1)
	* See https://github.com/digst/OIOIDWS.Java/blob/master/examples/oio-idws-soap/service-hok/src/main/java/service/saml/DigstSamlAssertionValidator.java for how audiences are validated.
* Run the Java WSP: Follow this guide https://github.com/digst/OIOIDWS.Java#start-the-service-hok-java-wsp
	* Download Maven package https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi and install it https://maven.apache.org/install.html.
	* Start the service-hok Java WSP: cd examples/oio-idws-soap/service-hok mvn tomcat7:run-war
* The Java WSP now is up, running and listening at https://localhost:8443/HelloWorld/services/helloworld. You can check the wsdl at https://localhost:8443/HelloWorld/services/helloworld?wsdl

### Update dotnet-svcutil

To add service reference to an OIOIDWS WSP from Visual Studio, your machine needs to have `dotnet-svcutil` version 2.1.0 or newer. You can update the tool to the latest version using the following command:

```CMD
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-svcutil
```
